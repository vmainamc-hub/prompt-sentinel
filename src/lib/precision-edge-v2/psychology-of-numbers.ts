// Precision Edge V4 — Market Psychology Engine (Demand Zone Philosophy).
//
// Philosophy (updated per operator specification):
//   The engine evaluates the five structural bar positions against a strict
//   parity and zone rule set. Every rule is a hard requirement — a single
//   violation is enough to reject the hypothesis.
//
// UNDER trades — required bar structure:
//   • Green  (most appearing)       → MUST be an ODD digit (1,3,5,7,9 preferred 3,5,7).
//                                     Digit 9 is a losing digit; only valid if ≥10.5%
//                                     AND pressure ≤ 0 (releasing/decreasing).
//   • Yellow / Blue (2nd most)      → MUST be in the winning zone.
//   • Red   (least appearing)       → MUST be an EVEN digit in the winning zone (0,2,4,6).
//                                     NEVER digit 8.
//   • Light-Red (2nd least)         → MUST be in the winning zone.
//   • Purple (fastest growing)      → MUST be in the winning zone.
//   • Digit 9                       → MUST be ≥ 10.5% AND pressure ≤ 0 (decreasing).
//
// OVER trades — required bar structure:
//   • Green  (most appearing)       → MUST be an EVEN digit (0,2,4,6,8 preferred 2,4,6).
//                                     Digit 0 is a losing digit; only valid if ≥10.5%
//                                     AND pressure ≤ 0 (releasing/decreasing).
//   • Yellow / Blue (2nd most)      → MUST be in the winning zone.
//   • Red   (least appearing)       → MUST be an ODD digit in the winning zone (3,5,7,9).
//                                     NEVER digit 1.
